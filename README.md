# FVTT Long Rest Hit Dice Healing for D&D 5e with Rounding Up

Adds the "Slow Natural Healing" rules to the dnd5e system. Rather than healing to full hit points, actors now have the option to spend hit dice on a long rest. This alternate version rounds up the hit die recovered. The original version, by Cole Schultz, is [here](https://github.com/schultzcole/FVTT-Long-Rest-HD-Healing-5e).
